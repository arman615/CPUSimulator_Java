# CPUSimulator_Java
The CPU Simulator is a Java program that emulates the execution of a simple CPU. It interprets a series of instructions
stored in memory and performs operations accordingly. This simulator can be used to understand the basics of CPU execution and memory manipulation.

# Getting Started
1.Clone the repository.
2.Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source code files.
3.Compile the Java source files by running the following command: javac CPUSimulator.java

# Useage
The simulator expects a file containing the program instructions as input. The program instructions should be written as a series of integers, 
each representing an instruction. Each instruction should be on a separate line.

To use this program, you need to provide an input file containing assembly code as a command-line argument. Each instruction should be represented by a single byte value in the file.
